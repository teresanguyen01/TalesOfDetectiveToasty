## Inspiration

**The Tales of Detective Toasty** draws deep inspiration from visual novels like **Persona** and **Ghost Trick**, and we wanted to play homage to our childhood games through the fusion of art, music, and narrative. Our goal was to explore the possibilities of AI within game development, using it not just as a tool but as an integral part of the creative process. We leveraged AI to create detailed character sprites, immersive backgrounds, and engaging slide art. This approach allows players to engage deeply with the game's characters, navigating through dialogues and piecing together clues in a captivating murder mystery that feels personal and expansive. By enriching the narrative in this way, we invite players into Detective Toasty’s charming yet suspense-filled world.

## What It Does

In **The Tales of Detective Toasty**, players step into the shoes of the titular detective, trapped on a boat with four suspects in a gripping AI-powered murder mystery. The game challenges you to investigate suspects, explore various rooms, and piece together the story through your interactions. Your AI-powered assistant enhances these interactions by providing dynamic dialogue, ensuring that each playthrough is unique. We aim to expand the game with more chapters and further develop inventory systems and crime scene investigations.

## How We Built It

Our project was crafted using **Ren'py**, a Python-based visual novel engine, and Python. We started from scratch, given Ren'py’s niche adoption. Integration of the ChatGPT API allowed us to develop a custom AI assistant that adapts dialogues based on player choices, enhancing the storytelling. Visual elements were created using Dall-E and refined with Procreate, while Superimpose helped in adding transparent backgrounds to sprites. The auditory landscape was enriched with music and effects sourced from YouTube, and the UI was designed with Canva. 

## Challenges We Ran Into

Our main challenge was adjusting the ChatGPT parameters to ensure the AI-generated dialogues fit seamlessly within our narrative, maintaining consistency and advancing the plot effectively. Being our first hackathon, we also faced a steep learning curve with tools like ChatGPT and other OpenAI utilities and learning about the functionalities of Ren'Py and debugging. We struggled with mastering character design transitions and refining our artwork, each hurdle teaching us valuable lessons through trial and error.

## Accomplishments That We’re Proud Of

Participating in our first hackathon and pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling has been incredibly rewarding. We are proud of our teamwork and the gameplay experience we've managed to create, and we're excited about the future of our game development journey.

## What We Learned

This project sharpened our skills in rapid development under tight deadlines and highlighted th  balance required between storytelling and coding in game design. It opened our eyes to the integration of narrative and technology and improved our collaborative abilities within a team setting.

## What’s Next for The Tales of Detective Toasty

Looking ahead, we plan to enrich the gameplay experience by introducing more complex story arcs, deeper AI interactions, and advanced game mechanics to enhance the unpredictability and engagement of the mystery. Planned features include:

- **Dynamic Inventory System**: An inventory that updates with both scripted and AI-generated evidence.
- **Interactive GPT for Character Dialogues**: Enhancing character interactions with AI support to foster a unique and dynamic player experience.
- **Expanded Storyline**: Introducing additional layers and mysteries to the game to deepen the narrative and player involvement.
